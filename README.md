## 💡 Why This Exists

In 2021, YouTube made the controversial decision to hide public dislike counts, removing a critical tool for community feedback and content quality validation. **YT Dislike Preview** brings this visibility back. By leveraging the open Return YouTube Dislike dataset, this extension helps you evaluate video quality in under a second before you invest time watching.

---

## ✨ Features

*   **Thumbnail Overlays:** Save time by viewing like and dislike counts inline as native-looking metadata directly on video thumbnails across your home feed, search results, sidebar recommendations, channels, and playlists.
*   **Watch Page Metrics:** Restore full context with the exact dislike counts placed cleanly below the video description area for a native-feeling experience.
*   **YouTube Shorts Integration:** Bring back dislike counts on the YouTube Shorts sidebar action buttons.
*   **Zero Configuration:** Start instantly. The extension works out-of-the-box using the public API, requiring no personal API keys or setups.
*   **Lightweight & Privacy-First:** Built entirely on vanilla JavaScript and CSS to minimize browser memory footprint, featuring a fully security-hardened Manifest V3 codebase.

## 🛠️ Installation (Developer Mode)

Since this extension is in active development:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anshupriyan/yt-engagement-lens.git
    ```
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
4.  Click **Load unpacked** (top-left corner).
5.  Select the root folder containing the `manifest.json` file.

## ⚙️ How It Works

A lightweight content script ([content.js](content.js)) scans YouTube's elements and injects native-feeling dislike badges. A background service worker ([background.js](background.js)) securely proxies requests to the Return YouTube Dislike API, validating all inputs and caching votes in memory to prevent redundant queries and ensure instantaneous rendering.
